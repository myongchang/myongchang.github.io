<font face="Verdana" size="2"><u><b>Abstract</b></u>:&nbsp; This paper examines the equilibrium
degree of flexibility adopted by firms competing in oligopolistic product
markets in which the value of flexibility arises from the initial presence
of uncertainty over consumer preferences and its eventual resolution.&nbsp;
The equilibrium choice of flexible mode depends on the following factors:&nbsp;
(1) the cost of switching product design in response to revealed consumer
preferences, (2) the difference in the acquisition costs of the flexible
and dedicated modes, and (3) the precision of the <i>ex ante</i> information
held by the firms regarding consumer preferences.&nbsp; The relationship
between these factors and the equilibrium choice of modes is fully characterized.</font></p>

for a retail chain are examined for their effect on the rate of firm innovation.&nbsp;
A centralized organization is defined as one in which store practices are
mandated from corporate headquarters (HQ) and this results in HQ being
the sole source of new ideas.&nbsp; A decentralized organization gives
freedom to store managers to adopt their own ideas and disseminates innovations
made by store managers.&nbsp; The difference in average profit between
the centralized and decentralized organizations is found to be a non-monotonic
function of innovative opportunities.&nbsp; The centralized organization
is preferred when innovative opportunities are moderate while the decentralized
organization is preferred when such opportunities are rich.&nbsp; Centralization
also tends to fare better in environments in which ideas are relatively
complex.</font></p>

industries with greater product differentiation have higher rates of return.&nbsp;
This paper shows that this effect breaks down in the presence of firm-specific
cost shocks.&nbsp; Greater substitutability in products generates two opposing
effects:&nbsp; (1) it allows a larger increase in demand when a firm has
a favorable cost shock, which more than compensates for the reduction in
demand when it has an unfavorable cost shock, and (2) it results in more
intense price competition.&nbsp; These two countervailing forces result
in industry profit being highest in markets with a moderate degree of product
differentiation.</font></p>

<u><b>Abstract</b></u>:&nbsp; This paper investigates
the multi-market business groups' tendency to <i>excessively diversify</i>
as an equilibrium phenomenon.&nbsp; The question of diversification is
viewed as that of choosing between the <i>focused strategy</i> (where the
firm concentrates on only one market or product) and the <i>broad strategy</i>
(where the firm commits to more than one market).&nbsp; The main objective
is to investigate how cross-market cost-interdependencies influence the
firms' equilibrium strategies.&nbsp; It is found that cross-market cost-complementarities
do indeed result in mutual pursuit of the <i>broad strategy</i> in equilibrium.&nbsp;
However, if the cost advantage from multi-market operation is small, this
equilibrium turns out to be less profitable than an alternative market
configuration which entails specialization of each firm to a single (non-overlapping)
market through the adoption of <i>focused strategies</i>.&nbsp; In that
the firms fail to support this mutually beneficial configuration as an
equilibrium, they are viewed as being confronted with the <i>excess
diversification dilemma</i>.&nbsp; It is also found that the pursuit of excess
diversification can exist even when diversification generates competitive disadvantages.&nbsp;
The <i>zone of excess diversification dilemma</i> is identified and characterized
for the case of duopoly.&nbsp; It is further shown that such a zone exists
for a more general oligopoly.</font></p>

<u><b>Abstract</b></u>:&nbsp; In a multi-unit firm, such
as a retail chain or a multi-plant manufacturer, we compare the business
strategies developed by unit managers with the strategies that maximize
corporate profit.&nbsp; The setting is one in which units face different
markets and where learning spillovers between two units are enhanced if
their strategies are more similar.&nbsp; When there is a small number of
units, we find a tendency for managers' strategies to be excessively tailored
to their local market.&nbsp; When the firm has many units, unit strategies
can be either excessively or insufficiently standardized.</font></p>

<u><b>Abstract</b></u>:&nbsp; This research explores how
market competition influences a firm's optimal organizational structure.&nbsp;
For this purpose, a computational model of competing multi-unit firms is
developed in which unit managers and corporate staff continually search for
better practices while consumers search among units to find a better
match.&nbsp; Organizational structure impacts both the practices at the unit
level and the extent of knowledge transfer.&nbsp; A primary finding is that a
chain should be more centralized when there is more competition.</font></p>

optimal when markets are not too different and the horizon is not too

does better when the search space is larger and there is a stronger correlation
in a consumer's preferences across different dimensions.&nbsp; A richer
